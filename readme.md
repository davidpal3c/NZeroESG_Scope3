### Sustainable Sourcing Through Agentic Ai: Trace emissions, materials, and vendor compliance across supply chain.

Procurement and logistics account for a large share of Scope 3 emissions, but tracking their impact is often fragmented, non-actionable, and without real-time tools to analyze environmental impact. This project builds an agentic AI system using **LangChain’s ReAct framework** to make carbon intelligence conversational, traceable, and decision-ready.

<!-- Spreadsheet calculations and post-hoc reporting are no longer enough. -->
<!-- - AI for Carbon-Smart Supply-chain: Conversational, Context-Aware, and API-Powered -->

This AI agent aims to make carbon intelligence **interactive** and **data-backed**, helping users ask natural questions like:

- "What’s the carbon footprint of a 100kg shipment from Toronto to Vancouver by air?"
- "Which laptop brand has lower manufacturing emissions?"
- "What are the carbon emissions generated by 100GB of storage? Compare AWS, Azure, and GCP."

It combines real emissions APIs, ReAct-style reasoning, and structured tool invocation to provide a data-backed conversation.

### The LangChain’s agent is not just answering questions — it’s:

- Making decisions on what tool to use
- Parsing and formatting structured inputs
- Executing external logic (APIs, functions)
- Referring to memory to avoid repeated work and API over-fetching
- Handling fallback paths when tools fail

### ⚙️ Backend (AI Agent & Tool Logic)

| Stack                      | Role                                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **FastAPI**               | API framework for serving LLM + tool interactions   |
| **LangChain (ReAct Agent)**| Agent loop + structured tool orchestration         |
| **OpenRouter / OpenAI**   | LLM model serving (configurable)                    |
| **Carbon Interface + Climatiq API** | Real-time CO₂ emission estimates          |
| **Transport-mode-aware API calls**     | Distance resolution from city pairs                 |
| **Caching**       | Persistent in-memory emissions and queries (in-memory -> Redis)                          |
| **Fallback Logic**        | Uses IPCC/ECTA factors if APIs fail or exceed limit |

### 🖥 Frontend (Chat + Visualization Interface)

| Stack                  | Purpose                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **React + TypeScript** | Modern, typed UI for smooth UX (NextJS)               |
| **Tailwind CSS**       | Utility-first styling with responsive design          |
| **Reacharts**           | Visualizes emissions comparisons and reporting        |
| **Framer Motion**      | UI animations, loading indicators, typing simulation  |
| **React Query**        | Efficient client-server state handling                |

**Features:**
- Resizable chat UI with drag-handle
- Real-time streaming messages with metadata (confidence, source, time)  
- Tool metadata (confidence, processing time, sources)
- Follow-up and context-aware replies
- Auto-scrolling, error-friendly UX, typing indicators
- Typing indicators, graceful error handling, follow-up logic

### Implemented Features (Backend)

- LangChain ReAct Agent with structured tool use
- Configurable LLM provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- EmissionsCalculator tool (real API + fallback logic)
- DistanceResolver tool (OpenRouteServiceAPI + geopy + Nominatim)
- OptionComparer tool (supports truck, train, ship, plane)
- Input parser: extracts origin, destination, weight, transport mode
- Clear fallback to reliable emission factors (IPCC, ECTA, CN Rail)
- Conversation memory with LangChain `ConversationBufferMemory`
- Emissions caching via hash key (avoids redundant API calls)



### What's Coming (2025)
